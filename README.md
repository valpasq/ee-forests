# ee-forests

An [interactive Google Earth Engine application](https://bglass.users.earthengine.app/view/forest-dataset-explorer) that compares forested-area (based on pixel counts) for CONUS from different remote sensing datasets. 

### Objective
The objective of this project was to (a) quantify US forest estimates from two-dozen different land cover products (e.g. NLCD, LCMS, LCMAP, Hansen, etc.), and (b) aggregate this information in an application/tabular format that allowed for temporal and spatial comparison of these estimates. EE App development written in file **product_visualizer**.
