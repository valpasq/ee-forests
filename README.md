# ee-forests

The objective of this project was to (a) generate US forest extent estimates from two-dozen different land recover datasets (e.g. NLCD, LCMS, LCMAP, Hansen, etc.), and (b) aggregate this information in both a tabular format and an interactive application to facitate temporal and spatial comparisons.

See [config](./earthengine/config.js) for full list of datasets, preprocessing functions, and forest class reamppings.
